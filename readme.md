This is your basic to do list, it allows you to enter your tasks at the top of the page and these will be put into the left hadn column ordered by importance. Once you have completed your task you can click completed and this will move the task to the other column. 

You are also able to delete tasks if you so wish. 

In order to run this file you will need to clone and download the files from GITHUB

Once doenloaded to your system, go into the directory you have stored it at and run the following commands:

1: npm install 

2: mongod

3:(in another terminal window) npm start

4(in a further new terminal window) npm run build

5:if you'd like to seed the table with a few pre made items you can use the command: mongo < server/db/seeds.js

Although there is a glitch with the date in these files. 

Things I would have added/amended:

I would have liked to have made the styling a bit better but I'm still learning my CSS
I'd have liked to figure out how to keep this tiles and contents restricted as well 

I would have added a time field as well so you could be even more specific.

I'll hopefully add these in the next few weeks.
